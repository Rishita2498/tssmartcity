    <p>The story of Don Bosco Navajeevan, Secunderabad, began very early after the second provincial chapter of the St. Josephs province of Hyderabad in 1996, brought forth deliberations to launch new ventures for the welfare of street children in the cities Hyderabad and Viskhapatnam. This good aspiration of the Salesians was further strengthened by the excellent work being done for street children in Vijayawada by the Salesians of Don Bosco.
In April 1998, the Salesian Provincial Council took the sagacious decision of first starting a project for street children in Hyderabad; it being the capital city of Andhra Pradesh, and only later Vishakapatnam. They appointed Fr. Maddichetty Noel to spearhead this mission. He was sent to BIRDY (Bosco Institute of Research and Development for Youth) to begin the work while also animating some of their programmes. Thus began Don Bosco Navajeevan Bala Bhavan, a project for children and youth at risk.
It was a very uphill task to find suitable premises to establish Don Bosco Navajeevan, Secunderabad. After months of searching, a three storied building was rented and by June 15th, 1999 the boys moved in to their new home and work began in a more systematic manner. We still thought to have our own infrastructure instead of being in a rented building. Again after months of search we found a three floor building near to the Secunderabad railway station and made the final agreement to purchase the same in the month of March 2000. Now the reconstruction of the building is finished and the building was inaugurated on 24th April 2001 by Sri. Devender Goud, Honourable Home Minister, Government of Andhra Pradesh. This would be our contact centre and the round the clock shelter for street and working children.
In the year 2001 May, Fr. Gopu Anand was appointed as the Director of the centre under whose guidance the Navajeevan has developed into five active centres. In the year 2007 May, Fr. Salibindla Balashowry was appointed as the Director initiated many activities and spread the services of DBNJ to slums and neighbourhood. The present Director is Fr. Bellamkonda Sudhakar appointed in June, 2013.
